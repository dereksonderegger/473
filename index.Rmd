# Preface {-}
This is a location for distributing homework questions for STA 473, Probability.  I am teaching this course in an IBL style where there is little to no lecturing, but rather studeents prove the fundamental theorems. As such, these notes lay out big ideas and definitions, but leave the proofs for students to work on as problems. I am basing the structure of the course on DeGroot and Schervish, but the problems are generally of my own making.

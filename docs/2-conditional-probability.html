<li>Out of <span class="math inline">\(n=17\)</span> students in a class, I will chose one at random student to give gummi bears to. In this class there are <span class="math inline">\(12\)</span> men and <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> women. Student <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is very interested in her probability of being selected. Denote the event <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> as being that the student gets the gummi bears. Denote event <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> as a woman is selected.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>What is the probability that student <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is selected?</li>
<li>What is the probability that a woman is selected?</li>
<li>Suppose I restricted my selection to <em>only</em> the women? What is the probability that student <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is selected. Can you write this probability as a function of your answers in parts (a) and (b)?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Consider the case where we take the sum of 2 six-sided dice. Define <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> as the event that the sum is greater than or equal to 9, and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> being the event that the sum is greater than or equal to 6.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Create a table of the possible outcomes. Notice that each outcome is equally likely. What is the probability that <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> occurs? <em>Use correct notation and leave it as a fraction <span class="math inline">\(\frac{???}{36}\)</span></em></li>
<li>Suppose that you are told that event <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> has occured. How many equally likely outcomes are there and what is the probability that <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> occurs? This will be denoted as <span class="math inline">\(Pr(A|B)\)</span>. <em>(Leave this as a fraction)</em>.</li>
<li>Notice that you the numerator in answer in part (a) is the same as the numerator as you had in part (b), but the denominators are different. What number do you need to multiple your part (a) answer by to get your part (b) answer. How does this relate to <span class="math inline">\(P(B)\)</span>?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>It seems that my children (Casey and Elise) get sick with annoying frequency. Suppose the probability that my son Casey gets sick is <span class="math inline">\(Pr(C) = 0.05\)</span> and furthermore the probability that <strong>both</strong> children get sick is <span class="math inline">\(Pr(E \cap C) = 0.03\)</span> If Casey is sick right now, what is the probability that Elise is also sick?</li>
</ol>
<p>When we talk about events <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, we defined them as possible outcomes, but it isn’t until we define probability of the events <span class="math inline">\(Pr(A)\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(Pr(B)\)</span> that we care about the sample space <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> of all possible events. What we are now trying to do is to claim that some addition knowledge allows us to refine the sample space to some smaller subset of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span>, perhaps <span class="math inline">\(B\subset \mathcal{S}\)</span>. So for events in <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, we now need to re-scale all the probabilities to reflect that we now know that event <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> did happen.</p>
<p>If we previously know that <span class="math inline">\(Pr(A\cap B)=0.3\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Pr(B)=0.6\)</span>, then half of the probability associated with <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is overlapping with <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. So if we just restrict ourselves to cases where <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> occurs, then the probability that <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> will occur is <span class="math inline">\(1/2\)</span>.</p>
<p>Notice that our notation <span class="math inline">\(Pr( A | B)\)</span> is addressing the refinement of the sample space, but we’ve just defined our notation this way. We have not, and will not ever define <span class="math inline">\(A|B\)</span> because event <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is event <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, regardless of the sample space we use to figure out its probability.</p>
<p>We formally define the conditional probability of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> given <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> as <span class="math display">\[Pr(A|B) = \frac{ Pr(A \cap B)}{Pr(B)} \;\;\; \textrm{Assuming } Pr(B) \ne 0\]</span> If <span class="math inline">\(Pr(B)=0\)</span> then the conditional probablity is undefined. Notice that this can be happily re-arranged to <span class="math display">\[ Pr( A \cap B) = Pr(A | B) Pr(B) \]</span> I can also notice that I could condition on either event <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> or event <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, so we could also have <span class="math display">\[Pr( A \cap B) = Pr(B|A)Pr(A)\]</span></p>

Then we call the events <span class="math inline">\(B_1,\dots,B_K\)</span> a <em>partition</em> of the sample space <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span>. A partition of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> is often useful for caculating probabilities due to the disjoint nature of the <span class="math inline">\(B_k\)</span> elements.</p>
